# Snake-Game

This is a simple Snake Game project developed to learn more about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and the Turtle module in Python. The game follows the classic style of the snake game where the player controls a snake moving around the screen, eating food to grow longer, and avoiding collisions with walls or itself.

# How to Play
1. Run the main.py file to start the game.
2. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) on the keyboard.
3. The snake will appear as a small segment initially.
4. Food will randomly appear on the screen. When the snake eats the food, it grows slightly.
5. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can.
6. With each piece of food eaten, the snake gets slightly faster.
7. If the snake collides with a wall or any part of its own body, the game is over.
8. On every new run of the game, the scoreboard remembers the previous high score and displays it for competitive playing.

# Inspiration

This project was developed to enhance understanding of OOP concepts and to practice using the Turtle module in Python. It's a great starting point for beginners to delve into game development and learn about handling game logic, user input, and managing game state.

Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or use this project to learn more about Python programming and game development! Enjoy playing!
